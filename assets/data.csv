In wheat and  barley they were very low (around 1 %). These crops are typically grown at the higher  altitudes, where insect activity is low and storage periods are short (3-4 months).  Sorghum and maize suffered higher losses (4-6%). However, it was demonstrated  that correct application of storage insecticides achieved a significant reduction of  losses in maize (to 0.5%). Losses in beans were very variable (<1%- 15%).",,Expert Opinion,"Robin Boxall, (1988), Grains Post-Harvest Loss Assessment In Ethiopia",http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/1/Doc-0205.pdf,

(2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper.,,Literature Review,"Muhammad Sattar; Mueen-u-Din; Mushtaq Ali; Liaqat Ali; Masood Qadir Waqar; Muhammad Anjum Ali; Laila Khalid, (2015), Grain Losses Of Wheat As Affected By Different Harvesting And Threshing Techniques",,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the  cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .

Both the relatively  low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,  highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using  nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates  based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection  leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,  humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to  use less effective storage technologies.  15"

Weight losses during storage losses of Nerica 1 and Nerica 2.      The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x  3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.",Controlled Experiment,"Appiah F; Guisse R; Dartey P. K.

Mould damage is regarded by local farmers as more of an inconvenience than a loss , since all the grain will be used for food or for brewing after washing to remove visible',","A loss assessment survey was conducted in the major cereal and pulse crop producing  areas of Arrillara, Oromiya and Southern Regions. Cereal production was adversely  affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the  growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy  unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.  This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,  consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and  where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure  reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.  Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the  total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important  problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to  avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay  taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main  reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices  removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at  higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through  retention of more grain on the farm.  Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage  and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the  history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.  Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a  'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing  with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain  use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.",Survey,"Robin Boxall, (1988), Grains Post-Harvest Loss Assessment In Ethiopia",http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/,"Weight losses during storage are variable and have been estimated to be 3.3 % for maize , 2.1 % for wheat and 2.4 % for t ' eff .

'The project found that significant reductions in the loss caused by insects can be achieved through use of insecticides ( losses recorded in untreated and treated maize were 5.5 % and 0.4 % respectively ) and that farmers will store treated grain for longer periods to benefit from seasonal price rises ."

Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980).     Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%, 0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas,     Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting losses.     Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively.     Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper.     Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period.   Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage.     Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains.

They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses.,,Literature Review,"Muhammad Sattar; Mueen-u-Din; Mushtaq Ali; Liaqat Ali; Masood Qadir Waqar; Muhammad Anjum Ali; Laila Khalid, (2015), Grain Losses Of Wheat As Affected By Different Harvesting And Threshing Techniques",,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the  cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980).     Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%, 0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas,     Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting losses.     Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively.     Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper.     Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period.   Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage.     Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses.       Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing.     AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting.     Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .

Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”  21 International Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry V2 ● I6 ● June 2015  Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .

Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”  21 International Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry V2 ● I6 ● June 2015  Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .

Other reasons  include weather  conditions, wrong  size and appearance,  agricultural  problems","There are a total of around 90–100 farms where field peas for human  consumption are grown. The cultivation of field peas is associated with a degree of risk,  since the yield varies considerably from year to year. Therefore, the proportion of land  used for pea production at farm level is normally quite low.     There is no statistical data (cultivated area, number of holdings, yield) exclusively  on field peas for human consumption in the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s database.  Instead, the data presented for field peas includes peas for human consumption as well  as for feed. According to the commercial buyers, the total area used for cultivation of  field peas each year is approximately 1,250 hectares.  One of the two commercial buyers contracts around 40 farmers in the  Kalmar/Öland region and delivers the peas to the food industry. The total area used for  the cultivation of field peas in this area is approximately 350 hectares. We have no data  for the yield. The total losses in the buyer’s processing chain were 8% in 2013.  Approximately 20–30% of the losses were suitable for human consumption. Crop that  is downgraded by the buyer is used as animal feed.  The other buyer currently contracts around 50–60 farmers in Östergötland County.  The number has increased in the last few years. The peas are sold under the brand “Go  green” in smaller (grocery stores) and larger (canteens/catering facilities) volumes. The  buyer also exports about 400 tonnes/year to a company that produces canned field pea  soup. The total area used for the cultivation of field peas in Östergötland is around 800–  1,000 hectares. The average yield is 3 tonnes/hectare and the total yield is 8,500–9,500  tonnes per year    A questionnaire was sent to 41 farmers and the two commercial buyers of field peas for  human consumption in Sweden. The commercial buyers were also contacted during the  analysis of the results.",Survey,"Hanna Hartikainen; Erik Svanes; Ulrika Franke; Lisbeth Mogensen; Staffan Andersson; Rebekka Bond; Camilla Burman; Elin Einarsson; Patrik Eklöf Katri Joensuu; Marie E.
